      PyConZA offers a mentorship program for inexperienced speakers. If you would like assistance preparing your submission, email team@za.pycon.org with a rough draft of your talk proposal, and we'll find a suitable, experienced speaker to act as a mentor.

    <mj-text>
      If you want to present something that doesn't fit into the standard talk categories at PyConZA, please contact the organising committee at team@za.pycon.org so we can discuss whether that will be feasible.
