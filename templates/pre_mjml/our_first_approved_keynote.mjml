    <mj-text>
      The title may seem like clickbait, but don't let that dissuade you! This will actually be an invaluable talk for all developers as it addresses many of the soft skills around developing and selling software that all of us could benefit from improving upon. In the speaker's own words:
    </mj-text>
    <mj-text mj-class="blurb">
      I'll discuss how to get started, evaluating your ideas, building your product, and getting your first users and customers. The talk will draw from years of work building and selling software myself, as well as the experience I've gained from helping hundreds of others launch their own businesses.

      Please note that we would like to fund as many people as possible, so we will prioritise more people who only need conference tickets over fewer people who need us to cover travel and accommodation expenses.
