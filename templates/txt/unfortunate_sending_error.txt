Unfortunate sending error
=========================
We would like to apologise for an error on our part.
When the PyConZA organising committee sent out our last mass mailer, we used a new bulk email feature from our mail-sending provider. We misunderstood one of the arguments in their API, exposing your email address to other recipients in our mailing list.

We apologise for exposing the personal information you entrusted us with and promise not to repeat this mistake in the future.

Sincerely,
The PyConZA organising committee
