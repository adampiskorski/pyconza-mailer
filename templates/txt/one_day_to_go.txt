Ticket sales are still open
===========================
Yesterday, ticket sales were erroneously stopped as Quicket thought we had sold out. This has been corrected, and you still buy your tickets if you havenâ€™t done so aready, including during the conference.

Parking
=======
Belmont Square itself (where the J&J Conference Centre is inside) has very little parking, so parking will be located at the Rygersdal Sports Club nearby. J&J will provide a shuttle service to drive you to and from the venue.
