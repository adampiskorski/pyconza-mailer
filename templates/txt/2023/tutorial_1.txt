New tutorial!
=========
We are excited to announce our first accepted PyConZA 2023 üêç tutorial, üçÉ "Airflow - beyond the basics (and also some basics)" by Sheena O'Connell.

Tutorial description
==============
"Apache Airflow is a platform that allows Pythonistas to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. It was originally created by the nice folks at Airbnb because they had a lot of problems.
Now Airflow is open source and pretty well documented. But it has a few gotchas and unexpected behaviours."
