New tutorial available!
=======================
The reputable Sheena O'Connell will be running a tutorial on HTMX "Modern web frontend development with Python, HTMX and friends"!

"””Once upon a time, if you wanted to build a modern web experience using a Python based web framework, an obvious choice was to expose a bunch of APIs and build your frontend in something else entirely (eg React).
