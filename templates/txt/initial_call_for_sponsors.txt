First call for sponsors for PyConZA 2024!
=========================================

South Africa's annual Python programming language conference, PyConZA, is taking place in October this year. We're inviting you to sponsor the event.

This year's conference will be back in Cape Town, the original PyConZA birthplace. Cape Town is a Python developer hub, with historically vibrant, well-attended Python conferences.

Why sponsor?
===========
Sponsorship gives your company exposure to 200+ Python developers at the conference itself, and to the wider Python developer community through conference advertising. Sponsorship gives you a way to build brand recognition in this community, and an opportunity to foster recruitment relationships.

Packages
========
Our package details can be found here: https://za.pycon.org/sponsors/packages/
This year we are introducing an Opportunity sponsorship, through which sponsors will directly fund attendees who would otherwise not be able to attend.
All of our packages include: advertising through the conference social media channels, exposure at the conference, opportunities to interact with attendees, and a number of free conference tickets.

If you have ideas for ways to sponsor that aren't in our package list - get in touch with us! We are open to new ideas.

How to contact us
=================
Contact us at sponsorship@za.pycon.org to sign up as a sponsor, or if you have any questions. We would love to have you join us in growing the South African Python community!

Best regards,
The PyConZA committee
