We are happy to announce our keynote for PyConZA 2023 üêç, ‚ÄúGreen coding with Python‚Äù, by Rudi Giesler.

Keynote description

"Green coding is an environmentally sustainable computing practice.

In this talk we'll be discussing how to put this into practice in our Python applications, practical advice for improving the efficiency of our code, and common pitfalls to avoid. We'll also look at the larger picture and environmental impact of everything that goes into creating and running software."
