Venue and date selected
=======================

This year, we are returning to J&J Conferences at Belmont Square (https://www.belmontsquare.co.za/) in Rondebosch from the 2nd to the 4th of October.

We would like to thank J&J for having us and look forward to working with them!


Call for Submissions
====================
We are looking for speakers now that we have chosen a time and place.
PyConZA will be a hybrid conference (with in-person and online access).

We are looking for the following presentations:
- Keynotes (45 minute long talks on a subject of general interest)
- Talks (30-minute long talks on more specific topics)
- Remote Talks (30-minute-long talks that will be delivered remotely). Note that the number of remote talk slots is more limited due to technical constraints.

If you would like to give a presentation, please register at https://za.pycon.org/ and submit your proposal following the instructions at https://za.pycon.org/talks/how-to-submit-a-talk. We
have a number of tracks available: Data Science, Teaching and Learning with Python, Web, Scientific Computing, Testing, and Other (which includes all talks that don't fall under the mentioned tracks). We hope to notify accepted presenters by no later than the 31st of August, 2024.

Speakers will be expected to be available for a short Q&A session after the presentation. Shared sessions are also possible. The presentations will be in English.

PyConZA offers a mentorship program for inexperienced speakers. If you would like assistance preparing your submission, email team@za.pycon.org with a rough draft of your talk proposal, and we'll find a suitable, experienced speaker to act as a mentor.

If you want to present something that doesn't fit into the standard talk categories at PyConZA, please contact the organising committee at team@za.pycon.org so we can discuss whether that will be feasible.


New Platinum Sponsor!
=====================
Thinkst Canary (https://canary.tools/) has signed up to be our platinum sponsor! We would like to thank them for being our main sponsor for 2024 and being a consistent sponsor for many years, and we look forward to working with them. Please check them out!

Even though our Platinum sponsorship package has now been taken, we still have plenty of other packages that you can see here: https://za.pycon.org/sponsors/packages/
